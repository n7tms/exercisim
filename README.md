# exercism

I am on a quest to master Clojure.  Along the way, I'm utilizing sites with problems to solve to expand and test my Clojure abilities.

Exercism is one such site. (https://exercism.org/)

All of my completed Exercism exercises are NOT here. Some are so trivial that I can easily complete them in the Exercism editor. Others, like the ones found here, I want/need to conduct a little more experimentation.

Enjoy!
